Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans:- Python is called a general-purpose language because it can be used for many different types of programming tasks, 
and it's called high-level because it abstracts away the intricate details of hardware, making programming more accessible and productive.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans:- Python is called a dynamically typed language because variable types are determined at runtime, not during compilation. 
In a dynamically typed language, you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. 
Instead, Python automatically infers the type based on the value assigned to the variable.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans:- Pros :- 
        1. Easy to Learn and Use:
           - Python’s simple, readable syntax makes it a beginner-friendly language. Its code is easy to write, read, and understand, making development faster and reducing maintenance complexity.
        2.Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks:
           - Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like Django, Flask, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow) that simplify complex tasks, ranging from web development to data science and machine learning.
Cons:- 
        1.Slower Execution Speed:
            - Python is an interpreted language and generally slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. For computationally heavy tasks, the slower execution may be a bottleneck unless combined with libraries written in faster languages (e.g., Cython or NumPy).
        2.High Memory Usage:
            - Python’s dynamic typing and flexible data types consume more memory compared to languages like C or C++, making it less ideal for memory-constrained environments.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans:-
